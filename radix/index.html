                        <p>Radix sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that uses a stable sort subroutine to sort digits by the 1's place, then 10's place, etc up to the most significant digit. The parallelized algorithm was inspired by <a href="https://summerofhpc.prace-ri.eu/fastest-sorting-algorithm-for-distributed-systems-parallel-radix-sort-difficulty-medium/">Jordy Ajanohoun</a> from the PRACE Summer of HPC. In the parallelized implementation, the input array is divided up into smaller arrays of size N/P where N is the size of the input and P is the number of available processors. With each processor starting with its own subarray of size N/P, the following algorithm is performed:
                        <p>Each processor receives a subarray of size N/P. For each digit i where i goes from least significant digit to most:</p>
                        <p style="text-indent:50px">
                            1. Each processor stable sorts (this implementation uses counting sort) its subinput by digit i.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent:50px">
                            2. Processors exchange their data such that the aggregate array across all processors is sorted by digit i.
                        </p>
                        <p> The subarrays are gathered in order of processor index and the aggregate array is returned sorted. An example of this can be found below.

                        <p>The parallelized algorithm was tested for performance alongside the serial algorithm and C's standard library quicksort "qsort". Each algorithm was tested on random arrays of size 1, 2, 4 ... 2<sup>24</sup>. For each array size, the performance of each algorithm was averaged over 10 random inputs seeded by 10 pregenerated random seeds following in the practice of the mentioned HPC article. 
                        </p>
                        <p> For the largest input array size, the parallel algorithm ran in an average of 1.566 seconds while the serial and qsort algorithms ran in 3.854 and 6.144 seconds respectively.
